# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival using Python and Pandas.

# Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to clean, explore, and derive insights from the Titanic dataset through data manipulation and visualization.

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Key Tasks
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Handle missing values
- Clean and format data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze survival rates by gender, age, and class
- Visualize distributions and correlations

# Key Insights
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers, especially children, had a better chance of survival.
